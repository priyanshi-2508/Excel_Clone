1st task -> Set position of grid..
We can't use flex because setting of grid cant be done..kyuki jo hmara box h..uske movement m issues aa rhe h.
Now, try to do with position : relative,fixed,absolute
Top_Row ko position : relative and some left, but this will have issue taht it will leave some space at original place.
Now, give it absolute position, ***Absolute use krne k liye, uske parent[grid-container] ko relative dedo.***

Grid ko position absolute dedo and top bhi dedo..So, it will go at its position..

2nd task -> Formula implemenation k liye formula chahiye with address too..
Input is *Inline Block*. Make formula-container as display flex and adjust their child acc to that..
Also set CSS of both address-input and formula-input too.. i.e., set width height.

Now, we want address of cell at address-input box..
so, we will do it by JS
Code tab likhna jb grid ban gya hoga... Mtlb uske baad let krke aage chlna
allCells nikal lo...using .grid.cell k through
and uspr addEventListener lgado.. and find address usinf row and col value...
and use address-input mein insert krdo..

Now, we have one more bug.. That address-input must always contain A1 at its default value..
So click first cell using..allCells[0].click(); 

Now, if we want to make div editable, use contenteditable class

3rd task -> Edit menu-container and add all styling for cell
_____Read Input tags from W3schools_____
Write html for font-size, font-family,bui-container,align-container,color-container
Set some CSS which include..height width alignment margin or justify-content..Set some content in html and display:flex..
**** GAP is a property to create gap between two elements****
Gap works in both horizontal and vertical..
****Select tag has option attribute and value bhi hota hai****
Option has an "value" attribute
Add fonts too..
Now add addEventListener to every individual container for styling..
Address-input se value nikal lo and convert its address to rid and cid..
So make function getRIDandCID
and we will get objec from thus function.
Now, address woill help to give you current click cell address..

Now search element using document.querySelector to find cell
we will find UICell
and now change its style to what is choosed..For eg. addEventListener on bold will change bold value of the text..

And make it work for italic and underline too
