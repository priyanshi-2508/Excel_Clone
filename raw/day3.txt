task1 -> align-container working.. in grid.js file
find align-container using document.querySelector..
as we have 3 btns
so loop for 1 -3 and add addEventListener for click..Now change their alignment by finding UICellElement() and set its value to recent clicked alignment value..
Find that by getAttribute("class");

********Select element k liye event jo hota hai "change"********
now, do for font-size element.. so use change event..
find UICellElement() and change its fontSize property.
***By default value set krne k liye we can use selected keyword..***

2nd task -> Multiple grid and object
We also need to implement multiple sheets...To save data in sheets rather than making new grid always for new sheet, we will make a newObject for cell.
Every cell willl have it's object.... First option is to make attrribute for every cell.
Second is object. 2D array to  represnts a grid. And an object to represent a cell.
lets have a sheetDB arr, and now to represent every cell, we will add some properties used in 2D grid.
And hence, ye cell hmesha sync rhega UI cell se..


3rd task -> 2-way binding..
we can set active-btn class so that we can find which is active which is not..
Formatting on UI will exist..
So, while clicking in cell, if we click on bold, then we used to add actice-btn class..

Now, in allCells, find cellObject. and if lets say cellObject.bold == "bold, then remove that class from bold btn..
UI par bhi change krna hai , state pr bhi..Check in bold addEventListener and also in allCells loop.
and then do the same for underline, italic, font-size etc.

4th task -< New, download , save and open feature

So add value property in sheetDB

Questions :- Cookies,Session Storage,Local Storage , IndexedDB
Cookies, SessionStorage and Local Storage -> all 3 are client side Storage
WE will get them at browser.
Local Storage -> Its separate for different URL. Upper bound size is 5MB. It is a permanent storage => closing tab wont affect its storage
Session Storage -> not permanent, session is for browser tab. eg :- WhatsApp.
[Read more from developer.mozilla.mdn] It's unique for each tab.
Duplicate tab ki same session storage hoti hai..No issue on refresh.
It is only removed when tab/browser is closed.

cookies -> It is the very first thing came. Cookies k andr save hota hai data
they can track us using cookies.
Client request to server and it give response. Browser sends cookies with request and take cookies with response.

Http onlu cookies  -> They can not be changed..

//Now new. open and download feature
Set icons using font awesome or google fonts anddeign html

make a new file newOpenSave.js
let save = document.querySelector(".save");
Do this.. Read htmldom.dev/download-a-file for more details

We will use 2D array and we will stringify it 
and convert it to blob and add download attribute..
****Top js file k saare element/variable/function nicche mil jaynge hmesha****
