task1 -> align-container working.. in grid.js file
find align-container using document.querySelector..
as we have 3 btns
so loop for 1 -3 and add addEventListener for click..Now change their alignment by finding UICellElement() and set its value to recent clicked alignment value..
Find that by getAttribute("class");

********Select element k liye event jo hota hai "change"********
now, do for font-size element.. so use change event..
find UICellElement() and change its fontSize property.
***By default value set krne k liye we can use selected keyword..***

2nd task -> 2-way binding..
